Isayas completed his M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno and his B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Eritrea Institute of Technology. He has received several awards for his academic and research achievement, most notably the Graduate Dean's Fellowship, a $35,000 fellowship given to only 6 Ph.D. students a year at the University of Nevada, Reno.

Outside research, Isayas have been working to develop educational materials for Tigrinya speakers. To this end he has worked with [Binogi International](https://www.binogi.ca/) for more than 9 years to adapt and produce more than 1,000 educational video (and counting) lessons and accompanying quizzes to Tigrinya, covering multiple subjects including Math, Computer Science, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Isayas has also worked with WickWick publishers - a Finnish publishing company - to adapt four storybooks to Tigrinya with the aim of alleviating the lack of reading materials in the language and hopefully cultivating a reading habit on young speakers of the language.
