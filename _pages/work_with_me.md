My research interests lie in enhancing the usability of immersive technologies, specifically Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR). My goal is to enhance the safety and comfort of these systems by developing techniques to address current usability challenges. My research draws broadly from the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, AI, and Cognitive Neuroscience.

If you enjoy research and problem-solving and share similar interests, we could collaborate.
