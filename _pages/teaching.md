            After completing the junior year of my undergraduate degree, I decided to do community service as an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) teacher in Dekemhare Comprehensive Secondary School, Eritrea. This allowed me to introduce about 500 grade 10 students to the world of computing, most of whom were interacting with computers for their first time.
