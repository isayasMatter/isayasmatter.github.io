## CS 486/684: Virtual Reality, Spring 2020

This is a combined undergraduate/graduate level class that introduces students into the burgeoning field of Virtual Reality that is taught as a collaboration between the computer science and psychology departments at UNR. Topics covered in this class include the geometry of virtual words and 3D modeling; graphic rendering of virtual worlds; physiology and perception of vision and hearing; tracking systems and interaction design. I served as a TA for this course in Spring 2020 and taught the class an assitant lecturer in Spring 2021.

## Information and Communication Technology

After completing the junior year of my undergraduate degree, I decided to do community service as an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) teacher in a local highschool that I graduated from. This allowed me to introduce about 500 grade 10 students to the world of computers, most of whom were interacting with computers for their first time. This proved to be one of the most fulfilling and rewarding experiences I have ever had.
