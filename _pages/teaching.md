        <p class="card-text">   
            After completing the junior year of my undergraduate degree, I decided to do community service as an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) teacher in a local highschool that I graduated from. This allowed me to introduce about 500 grade 10 students to the world of computers, most of whom were interacting with computers for their first time. This proved to be one of the most fulfilling and rewarding experiences I have ever had.
