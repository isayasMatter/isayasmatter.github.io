I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the university of Nevada, Reno. I am a member of the [Human-computer Interaction (HCI) lab](https://hcilab.cse.unr.edu/) and the [Center for Integrative Neuroscience](https://www.unr.edu/neuroscience/research/center), and I am advised by [Dr. Eelke Folmer](https://www.eelke.com/) and [Dr. Paul MacNeilage](https://selfmotionlab.github.io/). My work explores

My research interest lies at the intersection of virtual/augmented reality, eye movement tracking and machine learning. I am especially interested on using eye movement tracking to solve some of the fundamental problems of VR/AR including issues related to cyber sickness, rendering and accessibility. You can see some of my published research work [here](/publications/).

## biography

Isayas completed his M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno and his B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Eritrea Institute of Technology. He has received several awards for his academic and research achievement, most notably the Graduate Dean's Fellowship, a $35,000 fellowship given to only 6 Ph.D. students a year at the University of Nevada, Reno.

Outside research, Isayas have been working to develop educational materials for Tigrinya speakers. To this end he has worked with [Binogi International](https://www.binogi.ca/) for more than 9 years to adapt and produce more than 1,000 educational video lessons and accompanying quizzes to Tigrinya, covering multiple subjects including Math, Computer Science, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Isayas has also worked with WickWick publishers - a Finnish publishing company - to adapt four storybooks to Tigrinya with the aim of alleviating the lack of reading materials in the language and hopefully cultivating a reading habit on young speakers of the language. You can check some of the recently published storybooks [here](https://amzn.to/3dXVMX1) and [here](https://amzn.to/3sWssUP).
