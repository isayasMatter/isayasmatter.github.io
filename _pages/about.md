I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada-Reno, advised by [Eelke Folmer](https://www.eelke.com/) and [Paul MacNeilage](https://selfmotionlab.github.io/). I am working on problems at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Cognitive Neuroscience and Machine Learning. Specifically, I conduct mixed methods research to understand aspects of VR that cause sickness and discomfort to a large percentage of VR users, and I develop technical solutions that utilize psychophysiological data (such as eye-tracking, and electro dermal activity data) to create adaptive VR environments that would allow users to have positive experiences in VR. I also investigate the applications of AR/VR for medical applications.

<h3> bio </h3>
I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at UNR and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Eritrea Institute of Technology. Before graduate school, I worked as a software engineer for some years. Currently, I am a member of the [Human-computer Interaction (HCI) lab](https://hcilab.cse.unr.edu/) and the [Center for Integrative Neuroscience](https://www.unr.edu/neuroscience/research/center) at the university of Nevada, Reno, where I conduct research at the intersection of HCI and cognitive neuroscience. I have received several awards for my academic and research achievements, most notably the Graduate Dean's Fellowship, a $35,000 fellowship awarded to only 6 Ph.D. students a year at the University of Nevada, Reno.

Outside research, I have been working to develop educational materials for speakers of my native language - Tigrinya. Through my work with [Binogi International](https://www.binogi.ca/about-binogi), I have adapted, localized and producd more than 1300 animated lessons and interactive quizzes in Tigrinya. I have also worked with other authors to adapt some children's books to Tigrinya. You can read more about this, and my other projects, in the [projects]({{relative_url}}/projects/) page.
