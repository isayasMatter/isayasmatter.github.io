I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the university of Nevada, Reno. I am a member of the [Human-computer Interaction (HCI) lab](https://hcilab.cse.unr.edu/) and the [Center for Integrative Neuroscience](https://www.unr.edu/neuroscience/research/center), and I am advised by [Dr. Eelke Folmer](https://www.eelke.com/) and [Dr. Paul MacNeilage](https://selfmotionlab.github.io/). My work explores

My research interest lies at the intersection of virtual/augmented reality, eye movement tracking and machine learning. I am especially interested on using eye movement tracking to solve some of the fundamental problems of VR/AR including issues related to cyber sickness, rendering and accessibility. You can see some of my published research work [here](/publications/).
