I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the university of Nevada-Reno, working on problems at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Cognitive Neuroscience and Machine Learning. My research interests are mainly in virtual/augmented reality, eye movement tracking and applied machine learning.

I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Eritrea Institute of Technology. I am a member of the [Human-computer Interaction (HCI) lab](https://hcilab.cse.unr.edu/) and the [Center for Integrative Neuroscience](https://www.unr.edu/neuroscience/research/center), and I am advised by [Dr. Eelke Folmer](https://www.eelke.com/) and [Dr. Paul MacNeilage](https://selfmotionlab.github.io/).
