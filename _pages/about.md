I am a President's Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Illusioneering Lab](https://illusioneering.cs.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota working with [Dr. Evan Suma Rosenberg](https://illusioneering.cs.umn.edu/). My research aims to improve current Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems by understanding the technical and perceptual challenges that make them less usable to a large percentage of their users. My goal is to make these systems safe and comfortable for everyone by developing techniques that aim to address these usability challenges. My research broadly draws knowledge from the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, AI and Cognitive Neuroscience. 

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada-Reno, advised by [Eelke Folmer](https://www.eelke.com/) and [Paul MacNeilage](https://selfmotionlab.github.io/). Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at UNR and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Eritrea Institute of Technology. I have received several awards for my academic and research achievements, most notably the CSE Outstanding Dissertation Award and the Graduate Dean's Fellowship at the University of Nevada, Reno.
