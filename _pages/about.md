I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada-Reno, advised by [Eelke Folmer](https://www.eelke.com/) and [Paul MacNeilage](https://selfmotionlab.github.io/). I am working on problems at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Cognitive Neuroscience and Machine Learning. Specifically, I conduct research to understand the technical and perceptual challenges of VR that cause sickness and discomfort in a large percentage of VR users, potentially making VR less accessible and less appealing to these users, and I develop systems that aim to address these challenges. The systems I create utilize psychophysiological data, and combine techniques from HCI, cognitive neuroscience and graphics to solve these challenges through the adaptive personalization of virtual environments and interfaces. Additionally, I have been working with an interdisciplinary team to develop accessible medical applications in AR/VR.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at UNR and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Eritrea Institute of Technology. Before graduate school, I worked as a software engineer for some time. Currently, I am a member of the [Human-computer Interaction (HCI) lab](https://hcilab.cse.unr.edu/) and the [Center for Integrative Neuroscience](https://www.unr.edu/neuroscience/research/center) at the university of Nevada, Reno, where I mainly conduct research at the intersection of HCI and cognitive neuroscience. I have received several awards for my academic and research achievements, most notably the Graduate Dean's Fellowship, a $35,000 fellowship awarded to only 6 Ph.D. students a year at the University of Nevada, Reno.
